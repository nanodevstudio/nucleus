## Nucleus Data Platform

Nucleus is a database platform for all your data storage and indexing needs. The focus of this project is:

- Extensible and flexible query model, allowing custom data types and indexes. This allows you to build your data storage and indexing needs on a single ACID-compliant system, or abandon ACID semantics for performance when needed and permisable.
- Easy to use tools for database modeling and interacting with data. Eliminate the need for custom adminstraction UI for simple data models by building rich types and powerful, general-purpose well-designed data browsing & bulk editing tools.
- Expressive real-time queries and powerful materialized views.
- Open source to allow the platform to grow into an ecosystem, while allowing hosted providers to provide marketplaces and make the setup process even easier for startup projects.
